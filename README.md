ECS 173A Project 1
By: Ann Ryan and Tucker Zischka

About the Project:
This project is a single script written in C++.
You will need a C++ compiler to compile and run the project.
This is built into many computers, including the UC Davis CS lab ones.

Compile our main.cpp file using the terminal command:
  g++ -o ip2as main.cpp
Feel free to use additional flags such as -Wall or -Werror.
Or skip using this command altogther by using a built-in C++ compilier in an IDE.
Or compile our code however pleases you best.

Run our project using the terminal command:
  ./ip2as DBfilename.txt IPlist.txt
Of course, replace the database and IP search list filenames with what you have.
